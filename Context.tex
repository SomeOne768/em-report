\section{Context}

\subsection{NTT DATA}

\textbf{NTT DATA} has a rich history spanning over 50 years, rooted in the establishment of Japan's first telegraph service. The company's evolution into a major player in the IT industry began in 1967 with the formation of its Data Communications Division. Subsequent milestones include privatization in 1985 and the spin-off from NTT in 1988, leading to its emergence as a leading information and communication service company in Japan.\\

In 1992, NTT data procured 6 million smart cards at a time where the annual shipment was still only in the hundreds of thousands. One year later, the company received the \textbf{Deming Application Prize} 1993, which  is the longest-running and one of the highest awards in the world,  and is a first for the information service industry.\\

From 2005 to 2016, NTT DATA embarked on a Global Strategy Period, aiming to establish itself as a "Global IT Innovator." This phase saw the company expanding its presence internationally, forming strategic alliances, and engaging in mergers and acquisitions to strengthen its global footprint.\\

In the current Global 3rd Stage, which began in 2017, NTT DATA is focused on becoming a "Trusted Global Innovator." This involves accelerating digital initiatives, enhancing profitability outside Japan, and fostering innovation through partnerships and cutting-edge technologies. \\

Through its long history of innovation, strategic expansion, and a commitment to excellence, NTT DATA continues to lead the way in shaping the future of the IT industry on a global scale.\\

\subsection{Problematic}


The human ressources and staffing workers were using non efficient nor pratictical way to manage employees and clients of the company.\\
Using Excel files to store a huge amount of data with the possibility of error and not necesseraly normalized pratice, this method wasn't maintainable nor evolutive.\\

A fragment of an application had been realized, using \textbf{Elasticsearch} as \textbf{database} to manage all the data contained in multiple Excel files. However maintaining Elasticsearch clusters requires expertise and careful planning to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Additionally, while Elasticsearch offers powerful search and analytics capabilities, it may not be as feature-rich in certain areas compared to traditional relational databases, such as complex transactional support. Finally, Elasticsearch's distributed nature can introduce challenges in terms of data consistency and coordination, particularly in scenarios with high write throughput or when dealing with network partitions without forgetting the higher amount of processing required.\\

The company wants a web application that can help its workers and to manage each one of the processes.
